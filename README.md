## üéØ Personalized Interview Features

This app now includes **personalized interview responses** based on your professional profile!

### How It Works

1. **Personal Profile Setup**: 
   - Your information is stored in `electron/PersonalProfile.ts`
   - Update it with your real experience, skills, and projects
   - This enables contextual, personalized responses

2. **Interview Question Detection**:
   - The app automatically detects interview-style questions
   - Personal questions get customized responses about YOU
   - Technical questions include your relevant experience

3. **Supported Question Types**:
   - **Personal**: "Tell me about yourself", "What's your experience?", "Why should we hire you?"
   - **Technical**: "Explain React", "How does authentication work?", "Node.js vs Python"
   - **Experience**: "Tell me about your projects", "What are your strengths?"

### Example Responses

**Before (Generic)**:
- Question: "Tell me about yourself"
- Response: "I'm a software engineer with experience in web development..."

**After (Personalized)**:
- Question: "Tell me about yourself"  
- Response: "Hi, I'm Sahil Kulkarni, a Full Stack Developer with 2+ years of experience. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Tech Company, where I focus on full-stack development using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and cloud platforms..."

### Testing Your Personal Profile

Run the test script to verify your personalization:
```bash
# Set your API key first
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"

# Run the test
node test-personal-interview-responses.js
```

### Audio Interview Mode

When you record audio questions, the app will:
1. Transcribe your question
2. Detect if it's interview-related
3. Provide personalized responses using your profile
4. Display your profile card in "interview-ready" mode

### Customizing Your Profile

Edit `electron/PersonalProfile.ts` with your information:

```typescript
export const personalProfile: PersonalProfile = {
  name: "Your Name",
  title: "Your Title", 
  experience: {
    totalYears: 3,
    current: {
      position: "Your Current Role",
      company: "Your Company",
      // ...your responsibilities
    }
  },
  skills: {
    frontend: ["React.js", "TypeScript", "etc."],
    backend: ["Node.js", "Python", "etc."],
    // ...your actual skills
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: "Your Key Project",
      description: "What it does...",
      technologies: ["Tech", "Stack"],
      highlights: ["Key achievements..."]
