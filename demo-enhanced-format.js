🔵 CLEAR DEFINITION:
"React, from my perspective as a Full Stack Developer, is a JavaScript 
library primarily used for building user interfaces, particularly 
single-page applications."

🔧 KEY CONCEPTS:
"The key components include: component-based architecture, virtual DOM, 
state management, and JSX syntax..."

💡 PRACTICAL BENEFITS:
"What makes React powerful is its efficient rendering and reusable 
components. This is important because..."

🌍 REAL-WORLD APPLICATION:
"In practice, React is used for building dynamic web applications. 
For example, e-commerce sites, dashboards..."

💻 CODE EXAMPLE:
\`\`\`jsx
function WelcomeCard({ name }) {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true);
  return <div>Welcome, {name}!</div>;
}
\`\`\`

👤 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:
"From my experience working on Cluely and other projects, proper 
component structure is crucial..."

📋 BEST PRACTICES:
"Key best practices include: keeping components small, using proper 
state management, implementing error boundaries..."
